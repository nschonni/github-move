## Learn How To :heart: Your Command Line

I travel all over teaching people how to use Git. Unfortunately, many people are new to the command line and therefore not very excited about learning Git.

This repo will become a quick and dirty course (served over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) that will help people get up and running with the command line.

### Great Resources

While you are waiting for me to finish this site, here are some other free resources I have found valuable in learning the command line:

- [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
- [Programming 101: How to Use the Terminal & Command Line](http://www.galvanize.com/blog/how-to-use-the-terminal-command-line/#.Vry5rpMrKqA)
- [Software Carpentry Lesson: The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

### Bash Scripting

Someday when I want to go further, I may need these awesome guides on scripting Bash:
